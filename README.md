## Project Description üìö

**We are Evolution** has teamed up with **Team 6** from the international software development school **ALGOSUP** to create a revolutionary swiping app for recruitment, inspired by the popular swiping mechanism of Tinder. Our mission? To transform job hunting and hiring into a fun, engaging, and highly efficient experience! üíº‚ù§Ô∏è

### Why Recruitment Tinder?
In today's fast-paced world, both companies and job seekers need a quick and intuitive way to connect. Traditional job boards are often cluttered and time-consuming, while existing recruitment platforms can be impersonal. Recruitment Tinder bridges this gap by leveraging a swipe-based interface that makes finding the right job or candidate as easy and enjoyable as finding a date.

### Anonymity and Fairness
One of the core principles of Recruitment Tinder is to promote fairness and equality in the recruitment process. To achieve this, we ensure that candidates' profiles remain anonymous. This allows all job seekers to have an equal chance, free from biases related to origins, age, and other personal details. Instead, our platform highlights the candidates' soft skills and professional qualifications, ensuring that the focus remains on what truly matters.

### How It Works
- **For Job Seekers:** Create a profile highlighting your skills, experience, and job preferences. Swipe right on job listings that catch your eye, and left on those that don't.
- **For Companies:** Set up a company profile showcasing your values, culture, and job openings. Swipe right on candidate profiles that match your requirements, and left on those that don't.
- **When Both Swipe Right:** It's a match! Open a direct messaging channel to start the conversation and take the next steps.

## Features üåü
- Swipe left üëà or right üëâ to reject or accept job matches
- Create amazing profiles for both companies and job seekers
- Instant messaging system for smooth communication üí¨
