| 1 | Create a mock-up for the project | Spending too much time on the mock-up will cause delays in the rest of the project. | ![High](https://img.shields.io/badge/High-bb2124) | ![High](https://img.shields.io/badge/High-bb2124) | Divide the team so that some members work on the mock-up while the others focus on different tasks. |
| 2 | Disease | A team member is unable to be present during project time due to illness or another reason. | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-e6b400) | ![High](https://img.shields.io/badge/High-bb2124) | The team member will be able to work remotely by communicating through "Slack", our primary means of communication for this project. |
| 3 | The client is changing the requirements | The client has decided to change some requirements for the project, which will significantly or slightly impact our work. | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-e6b400) | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-e6b400) | Communicate frequently with the client to understand their new requirements. Then, on our side, try to avoid redoing any "unnecessary" work that was already completed. | 
| 4 | Inadequate testing | Thorough testing is crucial to prevent bugs and errors in the application upon release. | ![High](https://img.shields.io/badge/High-bb2124) | ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-e6b400) | Regularly conducting tests using a structured process and ensuring that every functionality is reviewed after implementation. |
