## Week feedback

This week, a total of 10 hours and 30 minutes of absences were noted. The User Manual was completed, and we met the deadline to deliver the code. The code now includes the message exchange page, authentication, and login page. The WBS was implemented, and preparation for the final oral presentation began.

The project progressed at a normal pace this week. The team atmosphere remained positive as usual.

## Next week planning
