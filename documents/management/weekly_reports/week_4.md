## Team meeting

This week, the decision was made to have fewer team meetings to allocate more time to software development as the deadline approaches.

- One meeting was held on 06/05/2024 to keep the team updated on the software's progress.

## Week feedback

This week, we noted many absences, totaling 10 hours. Despite this, significant progress was made: the Test Plan was completed and posted, and the Technical Specifications were also finished. The User Manual advanced well, with the foundation established; it now needs more images and a review of typographical errors. Regarding the code, the login page, authentication page, and main page were completed. Our next focus will be on the profile page and the messages page.

Despite the many absences, the project progressed well, and the team atmosphere remained positive, similar to last week.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will primarily be on software development, but also on the User Manual and tracking the project with management documents. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) also needs to be finalized and incorporated into the management documents.
