### Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a cross-platform recruitment application using the Flutter framework and Dart programming language. This application will be available on mobile devices (both iOS and Android), tablets, and computers. It is designed to function similarly to popular swipe-based applications but with a different objective: to allow companies to search for employees.

The project officially started on May 14th and is scheduled to run for six weeks, concluding on July 21st.

### Project Scope

The scope of this project is to create an application that allow job seekers to find employment more easily in a completely anonymous format to avoid discrimination. The focus is on the human aspect and soft skills rather than formal qualifications. According to the requirements, our main priority should be the front-end development of the product.

## Project Plan

At the beginning of the project, we held a team meeting to brainstorm and discuss the project's direction. We also communicated with the client via email to clarify some important points about the anonymization of the candidates.

| **Weeks** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Week 1** | In the first week, the team will brainstorm and identify potential functionalities. Each member will create their own mock-up of the application to showcase their creative ideas. At the end of the week, the best ideas will be consolidated into two examples to present to the client. Finally, work will begin on the Functional Specifications and management documents. |
| **Week 2** | In the second week, work on the Functional Specifications will continue and be delivered the 05/24/2024. The development of management documents will also proceed. The Tech lead and Tech Writer will begin researching and documenting the technologies to be used in the software. Additionally, work will start on the Technical Specifications and the Test Plan. |
| **Week 3** | In the third week, work will continue on the Technical Specifications, Test Plan, and software development, along with the tracking of the project through management documents. Additionally, work on the User Manual will begin. |
| **Week 4** | In the fourth week, work on the Technical Specifications and Test plan will continue and be delivered the 06/07/2024. The development of the User Manual and coding will also proceed. |
| **Week 5** | This week, the User Manual and Code will be delivered the 06/14/2024. Preparation of the final presentation will also begin. |
