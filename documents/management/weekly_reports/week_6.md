## Team meeting

- This week, we had one meeting on 06/21/2024, at the very end of the project, to provide feedback on the entire project and conduct the post-mortem.

## Week feedback

This week, a total of 3 hours and 30 minutes of absences were noted. The entire team focused on preparing the final presentation and completing the last management documents, such as weekly reports and the post-mortem.

The project preparation progressed quickly, and everyone was able to learn their speech promptly. The team atmosphere was very positive, and members were eager to present on the final day.

## Next week planning

As this is the end of the project, there is no next week to plan for.
