## Team meeting

- A meeting was done the 05/13/2024 at the beginning of the project to setup the project.
- Another one was done the 05/16/2024 10 minutes before the end of the day to keep track of the project.
- Two else were made the 05/17/2024 at the start of the day and at the end of the day to maintain progression of the project.

## Week feedback

The kick-off of the project was fairly satisfying, we decided as a team to come up with different mock-ups which we will present to the client. Two main mock-ups has been keeped, and will be sent next week to the client.

Globally, all team members has contributing to allow the team to come up with theses final mock-ups, the team members motivation is on-point and few team members feels confident with Dart and Flutter technologies.

## Next week planning

The next weeks main concern will be focus on the Functional Specifications, and in parallel completing the Project Charter, Wait for the response of the client, finishing the GANTT Charter and finishing the RACI Matrix.
