## Team meeting

- A meeting was done the 05/13/2024 at the beginning of the project to setup the project.
- Another one was done the 05/16/2024 10 minutes before the end of the day to keep track of the project.
- Two else were made the 05/17/2024 at the start of the day and at the end of the day to maintain progression of the project.

## Week feedback

The kick-off of the project was quite satisfactory. As a team, we decided to create various mock-ups to present to the client. Two main mock-ups have been selected, and we will send them to the client next week. A total of 14 hours of absences were noted.

Globally, all team members has contributing to allow the team to come up with theses final mock-ups, the team members motivation is on-point and few team members feels confident with Dart and Flutter technologies.

## Next week planning

The next weeks main concern will be focus on the Functional Specifications, and in parallel completing the Project Charter, Wait for the response of the client, finishing the GANTT Charter and finishing the RACI Matrix.




=====================================================================================================


# Week 2

## Introduction
This week we had four project sessions. The primary focus was on continuing the Functional Specifications to meet the 05/24/2024 deadline. We also held meetings during these sessions to review our progress.

## Team meeting

- Two meetings were held on 05/21/2024 to remind team members of our goals and review what has been accomplished.
- Another meeting took place on 05/22/2024 to track of the project's progress.

## Week feedback

This week, a total of 7 hours of absences were noted. We presented two different mock-ups to the client. After a choice was made, we added more details to the selected mock-up. The Functional Specifications were completed and delivered. However, progress in coding was slowed due to the absence of our Software Engineer. Work on the Technical Specifications and the Test Plan has commenced. However, we are slightly behind schedule on the management documents, which need to be addressed next week.

All team members contributed significantly to the project again this week. Communication among the team is strong, and everyone is able to focus deeply on their tasks. One member experienced a challenging moment, but the group successfully encouraged and assisted him.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will be on management documents such as the Gantt chart and KPIs, as well as the Technical Specifications, Test Plan, and product software.

=====================================================================================================

# Week 3

## Introduction

This week, we had one project session. Our main focuses were on fixing the Firebase issue, advancing the product's software, and working on the Technical Specifications.

## Team meeting

Due to the limited project time this week, we did not hold any meetings. The team members were already aligned and knew what they needed to do.

## Week feedback

This week, a total of 3 hours and 30 minutes of absences were noted. We caught up on the delayed management documents, including the Gantt Chart, Risks & Assumptions, and KPIs, making it easier to keep track of the project. However, the advancement of the Technical Specifications did not meet the expected objective and only progressed slightly beyond its initial stages. We need to double down on this next time. The Test Plan progressed very well and exceeded expectations, nearing the review stage. The User Manual also started, with its overall plan created. The code progressed well but was suddenly slowed down due to the Firebase issue that needs to be fixed quickly.

Overall, the team atmosphere was positive, with everyone focused on their tasks.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will be on the Technical Specifications, Test Plan, code, User Manual, and tracking the project with management documents.

# Week 4

## Team meeting

This week, the decision was made to have fewer team meetings to allocate more time to software development as the deadline approaches.

- One meeting was held on 06/05/2024 to keep the team updated on the software's progress.

## Week feedback

This week, we noted many absences, totaling 10 hours. Despite this, significant progress was made: the Test Plan was completed and posted, and the Technical Specifications were also finished. The User Manual advanced well, with the foundation established; it now needs more images and a review of typographical errors. Regarding the code, the login page, authentication page, and main page were completed. Our next focus will be on the profile page and the messages page.

Despite the many absences, the project progressed well, and the team atmosphere remained positive, similar to last week.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will primarily be on software development, but also on the User Manual and tracking the project with management documents. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) also needs to be finalized and incorporated into the management documents.

=====================================================================================================
