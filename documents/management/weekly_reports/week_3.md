## Team meeting

Due to the limited project time this week, we did not hold any meetings. The team members were already aligned and knew what they needed to do.

## Week feedback

This week, we caught up on the delayed management documents, making it easier to keep track of the project. However, the advancement of the Technical Specifications did not meet the expected objective, and we need to double down on this next time. The Test Plan progressed well, and its advancement was satisfying. The User Manual also started, and the code progressed well but was suddenly slowed down due to the Firebase issue that needs to be fixed quickly.

Overall, the team atmosphere was positive, with everyone focused on their tasks.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will be on the Technical Specifications, Test Plan, code, resolving the Firebase issue, User Manual, and tracking the project with management documents.
