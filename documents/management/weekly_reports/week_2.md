## Introduction

## Team meeting

- Two meetings were held on 05/21/2024 to remind team members of our goals and review what has been accomplished.
- Another meeting took place on 05/22/2024 to track of the project's progress.

## Week feedback

This week, we presented two different mock-ups to the client. After a choice was made, we added more details to the selected mock-up. The Functional Specifications were completed and delivered. Although coding began, progress was slowed due to the absence of our Software Engineer. Work on the Technical Specifications and the Test Plan has started. However, we are slightly behind schedule on the management documents, and this needs to be addressed next week.

All team members contributed significantly to the project again this week. Communication among the team is strong, and everyone is able to focus deeply on their tasks. One member experienced a challenging moment, but the group successfully encouraged and assisted him.

## Next week planning

Next week's focus will be on management documents such as the Gantt chart and KPIs, as well as the Technical Specifications, Test Plan, and product software.
